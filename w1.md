#Week One Points of Clarification

##W1D1

1. Regular Expressions
  - Basic regular expression:

        ```
        var re1 = new RegExp("abc");
        var re2 = /abc/;
        ```

  - Special characters need to be preceded by a backslash in order to preserve their value:
  ``var eighteenPlus = /eighteen\+/;``

  - Testing strings for matches using regular expressions:

        ```
        console.log(/abc/.test("abcde"));
        // → true
        console.log(/abc/.test("abxde"));
        // → false
        ```

  - Square brackets indicate a 'catch all' regexp; the regular expression will return true if the string contains any of the characters regardless of order (a dash indicates a range of values):

        ```
        console.log(/[0123456789]/.test("in 1992"));
        // → true
        console.log(/[0-9]/.test("in 1992"));
        // → true
        ```

  - Cheat Sheet for catchall shortcuts:
    - \d  Any digit character\s\s
    - \w  An alphanumeric character (“word character”)\s\s
    - \s  Any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, and similar)\s\s
    - \D  A character that is not a digit\s\s
    - \W  A nonalphanumeric character\s\s
    - \S  A nonwhitespace character
    - . Any character except for newline

  - Indicating a repetition using + or * :

        ```
        console.log(/'\d+'/.test("'123'"));
        // → true
        console.log(/'\d*'/.test("''"));
        // → true
        ```

  - Question mark makes part of the pattern optional:

          ```
          var neighbor = /neighbou?r/;

          console.log(neighbor.test("neighbour"));
          // → true
          console.log(neighbor.test("neighbor"));
          // → true

  - Regular expression methods:
      - execute method: ``/\d+/.exec`` returns null of no match is found, returns an object with information if a match   is found (add .index to the end of exec in order to have the expression return an index position) ``.match()`` for  strings
      - replace method: ``"Borobudur".replace(/o/, "a")`` returns a string that replaces matches to the first parameter   ('o') with the string provided in the second parameter ('a'). Only the first instance of the first parameter in the   string will be replaced unless you provide the global option 'g' ``"Borobudur".replace(/o/g, "a")``
      - search method: ``"string".search(/yourRegExp/)`` returns the index of your regular expression


2. Ternary Operators
  - A ternary operator is a conditional statement in the format ``BooleanValue ? "result if true" : "result if false"`` i.e: ``hasEaten ? "not hungry" : "hungry"``

##W1D2

1. Shortcuts List
  - Sublime 3
    - ``[CTRL] + [SHIFT] + k`` = delete line
    - ``[CMD] + [SHIFT] + d`` = duplicate line
    - ``[CMD] + t`` = open file in new tab
    - ``[CMD] + 2`` = access tab # 2, ``[CMD] + 3`` = access tab # 3 etc...
    - ``[CMD] + [ALT] + left-arrow or right-arrow`` = navigate through open tabs
    - ``[CMD] + d`` = select (inclusive) next piece of text that is identical to your current selection
    - ``[CMD] + [CTRL] + g`` = select all pieces of text that are identical to your current selection
    - ``[CMD] + l`` = select line
    - ``[CMD] + ↓ or ↑`` = switch the current line with the line below or above

2. Node debug
  - node inspect myscript.js with debugger; in code where you want it to freeze
3. Functions that Return Functions

##W1D3

1. Types of loops and best use (using nested functions to loop)

  - For in: generally used for objects in the form ``for (var key in object)``
    - Advantages: allows you to reference the keys as strings and to make iterate through all the key:value pairs and make changes to the values
    - Disadvantages: does not loop through the key:value pairs in sequence (although it might appear that it does sometimes)

  - For each: iterates through an array in sequence

          ```
          array.forEach(function(itemInArray) {
            console.log(item);
          })
          ```
  **note:** the forEach method's closing bracket is outside the internal function's curly brace })


    - Advantages: quicker to write, and visually more simplified than for loops
    - Disadvantages: less control over indexical position than for loops
    - For each loops are similar to the map and sort functions, map allows you to reference an index using a second     optional parameter (when using map and sort make sure to return the contents of the inner function)


          ```
          input.map(function(item, index) {
            item.x = item.x * item.x;
            return [item.x, index];
          });
          ```

  - For: iterates through an array based on the inital value of a given variable, until that named variable reaches the value of a second variable, incrementing by a given value
    - Advantages: most control over the arrays values through indexical referencing
    - Disadvantages: longer format can be slower and difficult to read

  - Nested function loops: due to nested functions freezing the input they receive from their parent function, a returned nested function can iterate through values at a given increment, everytime the parent function is called (when assigned to a variable)
    **note** I am not sure if this is particularly useful for iteration, but it is a good example of how the scopes of a parent function and a returned child function interact

          ```
          var func = function(i){
              var i = 1;
              return function(){
                return i += 1;
              }
            }
          var foo = func();
          console.log(foo())
          ```

##W1D4

1. What are callbacks?
  - A callback is a function that is named as a parameter of another function i.e.

          ```
          var myFunc = function(a, b, callback){
            return function(a, b)
          }
          ```

  - What are anonymous functions?
    - anonymous functions are functions that are not named, and therefore the interesting part about them is how they are called
    -An anonymous function can be called by returning it as a nested function, and by calling it with a callback

##W1D5

1. Automated Testing
  - npm init + npm install mocha/chai
  - package.json -> directories "" -> include relative path to test.js

2. Modules, Libraries, Packages, OH MY!
   -use ``const`` isntead of ``var`` when calling a module with require

          ```
          const myConstant = require("./../myRelativePath/myModule.js")
          ```

  -Modules and packages are javascript and npm specific whereas libraries is a general term
  -Modules can be referenced internally, while packages are external, and they are both functionality that can be referenced by your code
